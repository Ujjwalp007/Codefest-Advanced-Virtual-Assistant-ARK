# AVA: Advanced Virtual Assistant

## Inspiration
The idea for AVA arose from a desire to create a tool that positively impacts lives. We were inspired by the need to improve accessibility for the visually impaired, who face significant challenges accessing digital information. With over 285 million visually impaired individuals worldwide, AVA aims to bridge this gap using advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, promoting a more inclusive society.

## What It Does
AVA is an intuitive virtual assistant designed to save time, enhance productivity, and prioritize accessibility. It offers a range of features:
- **Accessibility for Visually Impaired:** Reads text messages, emails, and documents aloud.
- **Personalized Assistance:** Organizes tasks, answers queries, and adapts to individual needs.
- **Integration-Friendly:** Seamlessly integrates with various software and devices.
- **Scalable Impact:** Supports organizations like libraries and schools to improve inclusivity.

## How We Built It
AVA combines cutting-edge front-end design with a robust back-end architecture:
- **Front-End:** A sleek, responsive interface with Three.js for a modular virtual face.
- **Back-End:** Powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (Da-Vinci), it uses APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion, ensuring high precision and a natural user experience.
- **Technology Stack:** Flask, Python, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Anime.js, and Three.js.

## Challenges
Key challenges included:
- Synchronizing facial animations with speech in Three.js.
- Integrating front-end and back-end seamlessly with Flask.
- Achieving natural, human-like text-to-speech output.
- Ensuring low latency and error-free outputs.

## Accomplishments
- Achieved a **98.05% precision rate**, outperforming competitors.
- Successfully integrated cross-language codebases in a cohesive project.
- Completed development within a 24-hour hackathon timeframe.

## What We Learned
Collaboration and perseverance were critical to overcoming technical hurdles and time constraints. We learned how to integrate diverse tools and technologies while staying focused on accessibility and innovation.

## What’s Next
Future plans include:
- Expanding to multiple languages for global accessibility.
- Enhancing interactivity with customizable graphical models.
- Making AVA universally available across platforms and devices.
